# Loan Default Predictor
The fundamental problem lenders face is assessing and minimizing risk when providing consumer loans to a diverse swath of the population. This problem becomes more difficult when it is necessary to look beyond a standardized metric such as a credit score to determine whether to lend to an applicant. It is a vitally important task to have a system that allows those with a lower score or financial missteps in the past to have access to credit without falling prey to shady practices or being shut out of the loan process. The lending company Home Credit aims to provide credit for the segment of the population underserved by traditional lenders. Using data collected by Home Credit, we will aim to predict the risk of default on a Home Credit loan using a variety of metrics beyond credit history and credit score.

This repository will house all data, Jupyter notebooks, presentation, and final report associated with this project. There are intermediary Jupyter notebooks that detail the data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling steps taken. The final report will explain the process and provide actionable recommendations and analysis for Home Credit or other lenders to use.
